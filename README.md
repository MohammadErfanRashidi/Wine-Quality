# Wine Quality Prediction using Random Forest Classifier

This project demonstrates how to use a Random Forest Classifier to predict the quality of red wine based on various chemical properties.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is "winequality-red.csv", which contains information about various physicochemical properties of red wines and their corresponding quality ratings.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- matplotlib

## Usage

1. Install the required libraries:
   
3. Upload the dataset "winequality-red.csv" to your Colab environment.

4. Run the provided Python code in your Colab notebook.

5. The code will:
   - Load the dataset
   - Preprocess the data (e.g., scaling features)
   - Train a Random Forest Classifier model
   - Evaluate the model's performance
   - Make predictions on new data

## Results

The code will print the accuracy of the trained model on the test set. It also demonstrates how to predict the quality of a new wine sample using the trained model.

## Visualizations

The code includes a heatmap visualization of the correlation between different features in the dataset, which helps in understanding the relationships between the variables.

## Conclusion

This project provides a basic example of using a Random Forest Classifier for wine quality prediction. You can further experiment with different model parameters, feature engineering techniques, and hyperparameter tuning to improve the model's performance.
